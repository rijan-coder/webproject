    <h2>Major Hydropower Initiatives</h2>

    <p>
        The development of indigenous hydropower resources is central to Nepal's energy strategy. NEA is currently overseeing several mega-projects aimed at significantly increasing the nation's generating capacity. These projects not only address domestic demand but also position Nepal as a regional energy exporter. Emphasis is placed on run-of-river schemes and reservoir projects to balance seasonal variation in water flow. Environmental and social impact assessments are integral to every phase of planning and construction to ensure sustainable development. We are committed to transparency in project execution and timely completion of all scheduled works.
