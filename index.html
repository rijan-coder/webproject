    <h2>Powering a Prosperous Nepal</h2>

    <p>
        The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) is the state-owned public utility responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power in Nepal. Established in 1985, our primary goal is to ensure reliable and affordable electricity access for all Nepali citizens, thereby supporting the nation's economic growth and development. We manage an extensive network of hydropower plants and transmission lines, constantly working to upgrade infrastructure and reduce system losses. Our recent achievement in ending the crippling load-shedding crisis has been a major milestone, demonstrating our commitment to energy security. We are now focused on exporting surplus power and promoting electric vehicles.

        As the backbone of Nepal's energy sector, we invite you to explore our major initiatives on the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page, where you can learn about the scale of our current and future hydropower development plans.
